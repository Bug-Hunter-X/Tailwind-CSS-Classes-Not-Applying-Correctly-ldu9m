# Tailwind CSS Class Application Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Tailwind CSS: classes not applying correctly.  The `bug.js` file shows the code with the error.  The solution is provided in `bugSolution.js`. The problem likely originates from conflicting CSS rules or incorrect Tailwind configuration.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Serve the `bug.js` file (using a simple web server or similar).
3. Observe that the expected styles are not applied to the div element.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a resolution by addressing potential conflicts and ensuring correct Tailwind configuration. 

## Potential Causes

* **Conflicting CSS:**  Other CSS frameworks or custom styles might override Tailwind's classes.
* **Incorrect Tailwind Configuration:**  Ensure Tailwind is correctly configured in your project.
* **Missing PurgeCSS Configuration (if used):** Check if PurgeCSS is configured to include the necessary classes.
* **Incorrect Class Names:** Verify that the Tailwind class names are correct. 
* **CSS Specificity:** A highly specific CSS rule may be overriding your Tailwind classes.
